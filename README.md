gotetra
=======

`gotetra` is a Go-based package which uses phase-space tesselation techniques
to extract information about cosmological N-body simulations. The key
applications of this code are the measurement of splahsback shells around halos
and the generation of high resolution images of density fields.

Extremely unfinished function documentation can be found in this README and at 
http://godoc.org/github.com/phil-mansfield/gotetra.

Installation
------------

Coming soon...

(Briefly: it works like any other Go package. Just build the scripts in the
various `main/` subdirectories with either `go build` or `go install`.)

Project Structure
-----------------

There are three major branches:

- `render/`: Generates 3D and 2D (projected) density fields from a particle
snapshot generated by a cosmological N-body simulation.

- `los/`: Measures density along lines of sight from the center of halos. These
densities can be used to measure the splashback shells of halos.

- `compress/`: Compresses the position space data from cosmological N-body
simulations. (Very not finished. Currently lots of uncommitted ideas and tests.)

There are also a number of helper directories:

- `cosmo/`: Library with a few useful functions that calculate cosmological
quantities.

- `math/`: Library for computing a potpourri of useful mathematical functions.
In a lot of cases, this just means reimplementing things from the Go standard
library in a better way.

Python
------

Python code for interfacing with `gotetra` output is provided in the `python/`
directory. `gotetra.py` is both a python library and a command line utility.
Running it as `$ python gotetra.py my_gotetra_file.gtet` will print out
information about the file, and importing it will give you access to functions
which can read in `gotetra` headers and arrays.

The documentation for this is not fantastic, and I plan to make it better later.

Wishlist
--------

Here are some things which I would love to add to this project but do not
currently have the time to do so. In no particular order:

- Create a Python librarywhich captures the behavior of the command-line
utilities. Write Python bindings for all the important functions.
(Difficulty: *Medium*)

- Higher order tesselation techniques. (Difficulty: *High*)

- Generalization from uniform initial conditions to adaptively refined
initial conditions. (Difficulty: *Low*)

- Improved documentation. (Difficulty: *Low*)

- Convert various `gtet_foo` applications to a single `gtet` application with
a `foo` argument. (Diffifulty: *Low*)

- Restructure project in a number of ways. The most obvious and easiest would
be to move all the packages in `los/` which are imported by files in `los/`
to some top level package. (Diffifulty: *Low* to *Medium*)

- Write an introduction somewhere for the uninitiated. (Diffifulty: *Low*,
but only Phil can do it.)
